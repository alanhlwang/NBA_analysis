# Predicting the NBA All-Stars with Machine Learning

The goal of this analysis is to predict the [NBA All-Stars](https://www.basketball-reference.com/allstar/) for a specific year by applying machine learning algorithms on player performance data and All-Star selection data from other years. The analysis is based on the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) data analysis packages and the [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning package for Python. The [XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) algorithm and the [Keras](https://keras.io/)-[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) deep learning libraries are tested as well. The [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/) packages are used for visualization. NBA data are taken from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com). Data from 2000-2018 have been saved as csv-files in the [data](data) directory using the scraper functions in [*NBAanalysissetup.py*](NBAanalysissetup.py), data from other years can be obtained by using [*Basketball_Reference_scraper.py*](Basketball_Reference_scraper.py).

## Analysis

The analysis is presented as a [Python Jupyter Notebook](NBA_All-Stars.ipynb), and can be viewed online using [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gmalim/NBA_analysis/blob/master/NBA_All-Stars.ipynb) (which has improved display rendering capabilities compared to Github).

## NBA All-Star prediction 2018

At the time of writing the NBA All-Stars for 2018 were already selected. Therefore the analysis identifies three groups of players per conference:

1. **Deserved All-Stars:**     Players that were selected and are predicted as All-Stars.
2. **Questionable All-Stars:** Players that were selected but are not predicted as All-Stars.
3. **Snubbed non-All-Stars:**  Players that are predicted but were not selected as All-Stars.

The NBA players in these groups for 2018 are listed below, based on 2010-2018 data and in order of the median predicted calibrated scoring rank over all selected models:

- Western Conference:

	- **Deserved All-Stars:** *James Harden (HOU), Anthony Davis (NOP), Russell Westbrook (OKC), Kevin Durant (GSW), Damian Lillard (POR), DeMarcus Cousins (NOP), Jimmy Butler (MIN), Stephen Curry (GSW), LaMarcus Aldridge (SAS), Karl-Anthony Towns (MIN)*
	- **Questionable All-Stars:** *Klay Thompson (GSW), Paul George (OKC), Draymond Green (GSW)*
	- **Snubbed non-All-Stars:** *Chris Paul (HOU), Nikola Jokic (DEN)*

- Eastern Conference:

	- **Deserved All-Stars:** *LeBron James (CLE), Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL), DeMar DeRozan (TOR), Joel Embiid (PHI), Kyrie Irving (BOS), Victor Oladipo (IND), Kevin Love (CLE), John Wall (WAS), Bradley Beal (WAS)*
	- **Questionable All-Stars:** *Kemba Walker (CHO), Andre Drummond (DET), Kyle Lowry (TOR), Kristaps Porzingis (NYK), Al Horford (BOS), Goran Dragic (MIA)*
	- **Snubbed non-All-Stars:** *Blake Griffin (DET), Ben Simmons (PHI), Dwight Howard (CHO)*

## Discussion

There are several caveats to the analysis:

- NBA player data used in the analysis are summary statistics over a complete season, while the NBA All-Star game is played halfway through a season. Therefore the analysis might actually be more suited to predict the selection of the All-NBA teams awarded at the end of the season.
- All-Star level players can be injured before the All-Star game but recover before the season ends and still pass the minimum number of games requirement to be included in the analysis.
- Similarly, players selected for the All-Star game who get injured before the All-Star game are replaced by other players who otherwise would not have been selected. (*In 2018 for instance, Paul George and Goran Dragic were injury replacements*). Therefore the injured players have been added to the scraped 2000-2018 csv-files by hand.
- All-Star level players can transfer between conferences during a season. (*In 2018 for instance, Blake Griffin transferred from the Clippers in the Western Conference to the Pistons in the Eastern Conference*).
- All-Star selection is not only determined by a player's individual performance, but also by his team's performance before the All-Star break. Team performance is included in the analysis by the *TW* statistic (i.e. the number of team wins per season), but no attempt has been made to tune the weight of this statistic compared to other data features. (*In 2018 for instance, Klay Thompson and  Draymond Green played for the Golden State Warriors, the defending NBA champions*).
- Similarly, All-Star selection is (partly) based on fan voting, and therefore popular players can get selected even if they played poorly during the season (*e.g. Kobe Bryant in 2014, 2015 and 2016*).
- The 1998â€“99 and 2011-2012 NBA seasons were shortened to 50 and 66 regular season games per team respectively due to a lock-out. Therefore there was no All-Star game in 1998-99, while the analysis might be suboptimal for 2011-2012.
