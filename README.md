# Predicting the NBA All-Stars and NBA MVP with Machine Learning

The goal of this analysis is to predict the **NBA All-Stars** and **NBA MVP** for a given year, by applying various machine learning algorithms on NBA player data and All-Star selections / MVP voting data in other years.

## Data

NBA player data are taken from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com). Data from 2010-2018 are included in the **data** directory of this repository, data from other years can be obtained by using [*Basketball_Reference_scraper.py*](Basketball_Reference_scraper.py).

## Analysis

The analyses are based on the [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning package for Python, and are described in more detail in the following:

- [MVP analysis README](README_MVP.md)
